# openshift-selenium-phantomjs
This is a working example of using Selenium for Python (2.7) in combination with PhantomJS (1.9.8) on Openshift Online.

In order for this to work, PhantomJS had to be patched. The patch is included and automatically downloaded to the data folder during the deployment process. Selenium is included in this repository as it needed adjustments for the patched version of PhantomJS to work.
